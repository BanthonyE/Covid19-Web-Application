# Covid-19 Data Analytic Microservices Application with Kubernetes and OpenShift

We have seen a range data published on the impact of various parameters on the spread of covid-19, including population density, average number of people per household, ethnicity, weather data etc.
Have you ever wanted to run your own analytics on covid-19 data, and examine data sets in order to draw a particular conclusion? Or possibly evaluate a theory, that may or not may not be true. Such analytics could potentially shed light on the impacts of various factors, and you can apply them to a variety of problems.   
Maybe you'd like to see the impact of temperature and humidity on the spread of covid-19 in different countries?  

teach you how to build, deploy and manage web applications with kubernetes and openshift.

Our workshop series is around covid-19 data retrieval, parsing and analytic. This is a series of 5 x hands-on workshops, teaching you how to retrieve covid-19 data from an authentic source, make them securely available through REST APIS on kubernetes and Openshift.  
The main parser application is written in Spring Boot, but we will add more features and apply analytical services on the data in the form of microservices written in different programming languages.  

Our application also comes with User Interface that connect to our parser and invokes the API endpoints to showcase the power of microservices running as conainers on Kubernetes and Openshift. 

You can use this application as a template for designing your own analytical microservices and deploy onto Kubernetes.
